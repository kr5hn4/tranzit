**Tranzit** is a cross-platform app to share files on your local network.

## How It Works

Tranzit uses mDNS and tcp heartbeats to discover devices, If a device stops responding to heartbeats, it is considered offline. All the file transfers happen via secure https connections between the devices.

## How to use

[video demo](https://youtube.com/)

1. Connect both devices to same wifi/local network.
2. Open the Tranzit app on both devices, it will detect the devices automatically. If not detected automatically, click the refresh button
3. Select files and click on the device from the device list to send a file transfer request.
4. Accept the file transfer request on the other device to start the file transfer.

2. Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:
   - Install the required dependencies for your OS as per [Tauri docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#system-dependencies)
   - Install [rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) (preferrably the latest LTS version)
   - Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (preferrably the latest LTS version)

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Copy sample.env to .env: `cp sample.env .env`
